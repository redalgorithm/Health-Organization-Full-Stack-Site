# Full-Stack-Health-Care-Site
This site is running, but is currently incomplete.  I have spent the past couple days (and nights) designing and implementing some basic services for the user.  Kaesar Health Care is a simple prototype for a private health care facility.  This project contains a data model and database design along with specifications on columns and constraints.  This is a 3-tier architecture using the LAMP environment to implement this application.  The site is designed to enable the user to create an account (Provider/Patient) while using sessions to maintain state.  While signed in, users are able to create appointments, view their schedules, and make necessary changes/cancellations.  The assumptions are as follows:  Users are required to provide basic contact information during sign up (name, email, address, etc.). Days and times of availability will be according to company policy first, and then provider preference.  Appointment times will start on the hour, for one hour.  I also have a few ideas for the next update that I will provide soon.
